Data Journalism and D3

**Description**  
HTML page containing an SVG scatter plot, created using D3.js.  The underlying data with various statistics related to poverty and healthcare in the United Staes was loaded from a .csv, and the resulting visualization features selectable axes (and transitions) to view multiple correlations.  Tooltips are also incorporated to allow viewing of the statistics associated with each point on the chart.
